A simple kernel compile project for providing .deb packages of the Linux Kernel with firelzrd's BORE scheduler for use in Ubuntu-based and Debian-based distributions.

Currently "dog-fooding" (iykyk) under Kubuntu 25.10. If using an Nvidia GPU, you will need the latest proprietary drivers provided by Nvidia, not the Ubuntu repos. Using the Ubuntu-provided Nvidia drivers will likely break the graphics stack and force you to use a safe graphics mode.

Have fun using these debs for whatever project you want (license permissing, of course) but do so with the expectation that if you break stuff it I may choose to not help you fix it.
